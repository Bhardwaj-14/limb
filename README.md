Limb is an arcade game where you need to kill enemies like slime, rat and a bat for 3 minutes straight. You also have to sacrifice things. I actually was trying to build this game at daydream delhi but was unable to complete the game as I was a truee beginner in godot and it took me a long time to figure godot out but finally I completed it. I hope this atleast gets me to overglade(Hackclub's Gameathon at singapore)...
